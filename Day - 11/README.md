Design and Analysis for Algorithms - Practicals

## Adjacency matrix

- Defines an adjacency matrix A.
  
- Uses graph(A) to create a graph object G.
  
- Plots the graph using plot(G).
  
- Adds a title to the plot.

## Graph 1

 ### weighted directed graph
 
- Defines the source (s) and target (t) nodes for each edge.
  
- Assigns weights to the edges using the weights array.
  
- Uses digraph(s,t,weights) to create a directed graph object G.
  
- Plots the graph with:
  
- EdgeLabel displaying the weights of edges.
  
- NodeColor set to red ('r'), making nodes visually distinct.

## Graph 2

- The s and t arrays define the source and target nodes of each edge.
  
- weights assigns values to the edges, with higher numbers indicating stronger connections.
  
- digraph(s,t,weights) constructs the directed graph.

- arranges the nodes in a nice way using layout called 'force'
